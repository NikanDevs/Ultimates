<h1>⚙️ How to setup?</h1>

## Step One:

Make a file called `.env` in your preject's main directory `(/.env)`. Paste the code below into the file and set the requirements.

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_client_token
MONGODB=your_mongoDB_connection_string
GUILD_ID=your_guild_id
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
```

## Step Two:

Use `npm run register` to register the slash commands to your guild.

## Step Three:

After the slash commands are registered, use the `/configure` command to setup everything for your server and bot.

-    **Note: Make sure to setup every config using `/configure` before starting to use the bot.**

## Extra

Do you think the bot looks ugly with the default emojis? Try visiting `emojis.example.yml` and make them nicer :)
