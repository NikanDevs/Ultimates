<h1>‚öôÔ∏è How to setup?</h1>

## Step One:

Make a file called `.env` in your preject's main directory `(/.env)`. Paste the code below into the file and set the requirements.

```

Use `npm run register` to register the slash commands to your guild.

## Step Three:

After the slash commands are registered, use the `/configure` command to setup everything for your server and bot.
